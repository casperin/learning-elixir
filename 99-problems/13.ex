# Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).
# Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly.
# I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in
# problem 9, but only count them. As in problem P11, simplify the result list
# by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X. 
#
# See 11.ex
